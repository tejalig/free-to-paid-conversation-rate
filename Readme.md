Business Questions:

- What is the free-to-paid conversion rate of students who watched a lecture on the 365 platform?

- What is the average duration between the registration date and when a student has watched a lecture for the first time (date of first-time engagement)?

- What is the average duration between the date of first-time engagement and when a student purchases a subscription for the first time (date of first-time purchase)?

- How can we interpret these results, and what are their implications?
