# Business Questions:

### Conversion Funnel Analysis:
Registration to Engagement: What percentage of students who register actually watch a video?

Engagement to Purchase: What percentage of students who watched a video ended up buying the course?

Total Conversion: What percentage of all registered students became paid customers?

### Time-to-Event Analysis
Onboarding Speed: How many days pass between registration and the first time they watch a video?

Conversion Lag: How many days does it take a student to purchase after their first engagement?

### Engagement Behavior
Repeat Viewers: Do students who watch videos on multiple different days have a higher conversion rate than those who only watch once?

Popular Dates: Are there specific months or days where registration or purchasing activity spikes (seasonality)?

Lead Quality
Free vs. Engaged: Are "Free" users who never engage more or less likely to convert later compared to those who engage immediately?

from 364 - data science
- What is the free-to-paid conversion rate of students who watched a lecture on the 365 platform?

- What is the average duration between the registration date and when a student has watched a lecture for the first time (date of first-time engagement)?

- What is the average duration between the date of first-time engagement and when a student purchases a subscription for the first time (date of first-time purchase)?

- How can we interpret these results, and what are their implications?
